# Social Media API

## Description

A REST API for a social media app. Built with Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.

## User Story

**As a** social media startup,
**I want** an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
**so that** my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Usage

1. Install MongoDB on your machine (if you don't, follow the instructions on the [MongoDB Website](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/))
2. Clone the repo
3. Install dependencies using `npm -i`
4. Run `npm start` to run the server
5. Use your browser or an app like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test the REST API.
